# ðŸ”© Bolt
Bolt is an in-development TypeScript-based WebGL2 rendering platform. Its goal is to handle all of the WebGL2 boilerplate while leaving the user with as much of the raw power of WebGL2 as possible. Additionally, it comes with several classes and functions to make code significantly clearer and more organized.
### Current Support:
- [x] Canvas creation
- [x] WebGL2 rendering context setup
- [x] Custom vertex and fragment shader support via the Bolt.Shader class
    - Including array buffer support using the Bolt.Buffer class
- [x] Grayscale, RGBA, HSVA, and CMYKA color support via the Bolt.Color class
### Planned Support:
- [ ] Pre-packaged primitive Bolt.Shader objects (triangles, circles, rectangles, etc)
- [ ] Uniform setting via one function
- [ ] Classes for vectors and matrices
- [ ] Built-in animation support (you can still do this yourself though!)
- [ ] Hex color support in the Bolt.Color class
- [ ] A handful of accessible variables and conversion functions to simplify end-user programming

###### A note on documentation and development progress:
###### Work on this project will be slow. Not only am I a college student (so this is a side-project for me), but I am actively learning how to use the WebGL pipeline. If you have any requests or advice, however, I am open to considering it. Just let this serve as a disclaimer that I am one person with a lot on my plate, so things may not move as quickly as you might expect.
